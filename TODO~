TODO

1. logging
2. enhance exceptions handling
3. interactivity (making menu items check/uncheck/show/hide/enable/disable/change label from java)
4. add icon handling to the regular menu
5. do sth like a buffer for RPC methods invoked by python at java side
   (The goal is that python won't need to wait for the method finish at java side.
   It only sends Java signal to enqueue the method invocation and that's all.
   Special Java thread carries about all the rest. It should allow sending signals
   to python from java onItemSelection() method)
